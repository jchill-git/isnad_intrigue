The two CSV files (names.csv and names_disambiguated.csv) collective store the data about which surface forms correspond to which individuals.
 Each row represents an isand, and all the colums beginning with "names" reprent the sequence of names in the isnad, one name per cell. If a name in 
 names_disambiguated is in english, the name in the same cell in names.csv is a surface form of that individual. If it is left in arabic script, the
 name is still ambiguous.
